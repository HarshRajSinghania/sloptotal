"""Detect websites built with AI app builders (Lovable, v0, Bolt, ...).

Online "vibe-coded website" checkers mostly score style: Tailwind class counts,
missing security headers, buzzwords. Hand-written sites share all of those, so
the resulting percentages mean little. This module only reports fingerprints
that the builders themselves leave in what they deploy: generator tags, their
badge and runtime scripts, their asset paths, their hosting domains and
response headers. Each one was checked against live deployments or against the
templates the builders generate (see docs/SITE_FINGERPRINTS.md).

It reports evidence, not a probability. A site with no fingerprint may still
have been written with AI: code exported from these tools and deployed
elsewhere, or written in an AI editor, carries no marker at all.
