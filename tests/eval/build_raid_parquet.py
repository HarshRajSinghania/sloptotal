"""Build the multi-domain RAID corpus from local parquet shards.

Same cells as build_multidomain.py (domains x {human, gpt4, chatgpt,
llama-chat, mistral-chat}, attack='none', 400-4000 chars), but reads the
dataset's parquet export instead of the Hugging Face datasets-server API, which
is often unavailable ("the dataset index is loading"). Rows are picked by a
hash of the text, so the sample is deterministic.

    # download the train shards once (~2 GB), then:
    python build_raid_parquet.py /path/to/raid/*.parquet
    -> corpus_raid.json

Requires duckdb (pip install duckdb).
